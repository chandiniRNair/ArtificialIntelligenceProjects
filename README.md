# ArtificialIntelligenceProjects
This is a project I did as part of my Artificial Intelligence course for my Masters.
The folder consists of all the jupyter notebooks files in which I have done the coding to analyse the data set.
The project report has been included to give deeper insights into the analysis done.
Basically the test data is analysed using various deep learning techniques - NN, CNN, AutoEncoders. The data visualization by creating a
a scatter plot of the training data, by doing dimensionality reduction using TSNE and PCA.
Grid Search is used to tune the hyperparameters.
